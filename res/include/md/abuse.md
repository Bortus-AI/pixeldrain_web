## Disallowed contents

The following types of content are not allowed to be shared on pixeldrain. They
will be removed when reported.

* **Copyright violation**: Works which are shared without permission from the
  copyright holder. For copyright reports we need a formal DMCA takedown request
  originating from the copyright holder or a representative. See the chapter
  [E-Mail reporting rules](#toc_2) below. When sending a copyright infringement
  notice to our abuse address, please state clearly that it is a copyright
  infringement notice so that we can properly detect the type of report. Using
  words like 'theft' or 'stolen' won't work because piracy is not theft.
* **Abuse of minors**: Videos, images or audio fragments depicting abuse or
  inappropriate touching of minors will be removed and reported to the National
  Center for Missing and Exploited Children when found.
* **Zoophilia**: Videos, images or audio depicting abuse or inappropriate
  touching of animals.
* **Terrorism**: Videos, images or audio fragments which promote and
  glorify acts of terrorism.
* **Gore**: Graphic and shocking videos or images depicting severe harm to
  humans (or animals). I will clarify that I am not strictly against shocking
  content, and it is also not illegal in most places. When a shocking video goes
  viral it often ends up in the wrong places and it can cause mental issues for
  unsuspecting viewers. For that reason I will remove it when it gets reported.
* **Malware and computer viruses**: Software designed to cause harm to computer
  systems.
* **Doxing**: Posting private information about an individual or organisation.
  This includes publicly sharing private photos, videos or documents. Shaming
  and extortion are not accepted.
* **Revenge porn**: The distribution of sexually explicit images or videos of
  individuals without their consent

Violating these rules will result in your IP address being banned from uploading
to pixeldrain.

If you have found content which falls in any of these categories on pixeldrain
please report it with the report button on the download page or by sending an
e-mail. When reporting links through e-mail pay attention to the rules described
below.

## E-Mail reporting rules

Due to the large number of abuse reports pixeldrain receives every day we were
forced to automate the process. Messages sent to
[abuse@pixeldrain.com](mailto:abuse@pixeldrain.com) are automatically scanned
for pixeldrain links and processed. The first report we receive from a sender is
manually reviewed. If the report is approved then your e-mail address will be
added to our whitelist and all following messages are processed automatically.
For this to work efficiently we have to set some requirements on the mails we
receive:

* Messages are categorized based on their contents. Make sure the report
  contains a description of the type of content and that it mentions one of the
  abuse categories listed above. The abuse mailbox only accepts reports written
  in English.
* Do not add attachments to your e-mail reports. Only the e-mail body is checked
  for download links. The message scanning system will not check your
  attachments and download links within the files are not detected.
* Do not obfuscate the pixeldrain links. The reported download links need to be
  complete and valid.
* The e-mail must include a
  [Message-ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message-ID) header. The Message-ID
  is used to reference messages in our system, mails without a Message-ID are
  not processed.
* The abuse system uses e-mail addresses for authentication so we need to be
  wary of [message spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing). To
  combat this we require both
  [DKIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail) and
  [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) validation before
  we can accept e-mails. If either of these checks fail we assume the message
  was spoofed and it goes straight to the spambox.
* Only send abuse reports to
  [abuse@pixeldrain.com](mailto:abuse@pixeldrain.com). Messages sent to any
  other e-mail address are ignored.
* Do not repeatedly send reports about files which have already been removed in
  the past. We will block your e-mail address if this happens.

If your abuse report is rejected for one of the above reasons then you will
receive a reply with instructions on how to fix it.

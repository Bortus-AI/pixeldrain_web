# Advertising on pixeldrain

Pixeldrain uses A-ads for its primary ad space. This space is located at the
bottom of the file viewer where everyone goes to download files. The ad will not
show if either the downloading user or the owner of the file is a Patreon
supporter. The ad unit is a standard leaderboard format of 728x90 px.

A-ads is an advertising network which respects the privacy advertisers,
publishers and even the viewers. A-ads only accepts cryptocurrencies for
advertising campaigns. The banners are static images with no javascript and do
not set any cookies in the broweser. You can use adnimated GIF or PNG images to
show animations in your banner ads.

We also employ other ad formats based on the size of the file which is being
shared. If the file is larger than 10 MB we add a little floating pop-up ad in
the bottom-right corner of the screen, and if the file is larger than 250 MB we
add a popunder ad which is displayed when the user clicks anywhere on the page.
These formats are purely to cover the bandwidth costs assiciated with sharing
such large files.

# Brave and Pixeldrain

## <img src="/res/img/brave_lion.svg" style="height: 0.8em;"/> What is Brave?

Brave is a web browser focused on privacy and speed. In some tests Brave is up
to 3 times faster than Chrome and Firefox. It does this by blocking
advertisements and tracking scripts before they even get a chance to load.
Beside the speed improvements this also saves a lot of power and data, very
useful for mobile phones.

Websites look much cleaner without all those advertisements. I don't like
putting ads on pixeldrain either, but I need the money to keep the website
running. Brave tries to solve this by giving users the choice if they want to
see ads. If you opt in to seeing ads from Brave you will receive notifications
with promotional offers once in a while. Brave protects your privacy by putting
the logic for showing relevant ads directly in the browser itself. This way your
browser history never leaves your computer and the tech giants can't follow you
around the web. The earnings from these ads are distributed between the websites
which you love most, a small cut goes to Brave itself for developing the
browser, and some of it goes to you. That's right, you get paid for viewing ads!

The money that you get from viewing ads (and receiving free token grants) goes
into a cryptocurrency wallet which is built right into the browser. Once you
have earned some rewards you have a few options. You can choose to automatically
distribute them between websites which you spend the most time on, you can tip
your favourite websites by pressing the tip button in the address bar or you can
convert the money to your own currency and deposit it to your bank account.

Of course I would really appreciate it if you tipped some coins to pixeldrain
once in a while ;-)

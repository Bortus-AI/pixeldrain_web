	I created a desktop client for users who want the convenience to 
	share (parts of) their desktop with just the press of a key. 
	<a target='_blank' href='http://pd.fornax96.me/u/pO-V-4'>You can 
		check out the client in action here</a>. The client will also zip 
	files for you automatically when you try to upload multiple files 
	at once, just to save you those valueable seconds!

<h2>Using PixelDrain</h2>

I bet you're very excited to start using it! You can download it 
from here, but there are some important things you need to know 
before you start using it:
<br/>
<ul>
	<li>
		PixelDrain requires a Java Runtime Environment of at least 
		version 1.8 to be installed. If you're using Ubuntu you can get it 
		<a href='http://www.webupd8.org/2012/09/install-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-via-ppa.html' target='_blank'>from here</a>. 
		If you're using somtehing else you can download it 
		<a href='http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html' target='_blank'>from oracle</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		You should know that this is a very early build of the client, any 
		bugs or issues you encounter should be reported to me, you can 
		reach me <a href='http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Fornax96' target="_blank">on reddit</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		The settings panel has no functionality yet, it's just 
		there to show what it will look like when it's finished.
	</li>
	<li>
		The maximum upload size is 50 MB, any bigger files will be 
		rejected.
	</li>
	<li>
		There is no installer yet, just put it in some directory 
		and run PixelDrain2.jar to start. The lib folder has to be 
		in the same directory!
	</li>
	<li>
		During the first run it will install itself in your system's 
		config directory, under Linux that is "~/.config/PixelDrain/".
	</li>
	<li>
		From my limited testing on Windows I noticed that screenshot 
		thumbnails do not correctly show up under Windows. I might 
		fix that soon, but it's not currently a priority.
	</li>
</ul>

			<h1>What is Pixeldrain?</h1>
			<p>
				Pixeldrain is a file sharing website built for speed and ease of
				use.
			</p>
			<p>
				The file size limit is 10 GB. There is no limit on the number of
				files you can upload. A list can contain up to 10000 files.

			<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

			<h3>For how long will my files be stored?</h3>
			<p>
				Files will be removed if they have not been viewed for 100 days.
				A view is counted when someone visits the file's download page
				(pixeldrain.com/u/somefile) or views the file through a list the
				file is included in (pixeldrain.com/l/somelist).
			</p>
			<p>
				You cannot delete files yourself. Once a file has been uploaded
				to pixeldrain it will stay there for at least 100 days. If you
				accidentally upload something you shouldn't have, just don't
				share the link. The file will expire eventually. File links are
				not indexed or published anywhere. As long as you don't share it
				nobody will see it.
			</p>

			<h3>Does pixeldrain cost any money?</h3>
			<p>
				No, pixeldrain is completely free at the moment. While there is
				an advertisement on the file downloading page, it doesn't
				generate nearly enough revenue to pay for maintaining this
				service. That's why I'd really appreciate it if you could spare
				some coins. Possible methods for donating are:

			<h3>Do I need to register an account?</h3>
			<p>
				Not if you don't want to. You're free to use pixeldrain
				completely anonymously. Without a pixeldrain account you can
				upload files, download files and create lists of files. And view
				your uploaded files on the <a href="/history">history page</a>.
				This page only shows files which were uploaded anonymously in
				this web browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				By registering an account on pixeldrain you will be able to
				access your files from any device with a web browser. Files you
				upload and lists you create will be linked to your pixeldrain
				account and will show up on your <a href="/user">personal home
				page</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>What cookies does pixeldrain use?</h3>
			<p>
				When uploading a file pixeldrain will install a cookie named
				'pduploads'. This cookie keeps a dot-separated list of all files
				you have uploaded anonymously in this browser. This cookie is
				<b>only</b> used for viewing your upload history.
			</p>
			<p>
				When logging in to a pixeldrain account a cookie named
				'pd_auth_key' will be installed. This cookie keeps your login
				session active. When you delete it you will be logged out of
				your account.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you use the style selector at the bottom of this page a
				cookie called 'style' will be set. This cookie controls the
				appearance of the website for you.
			</p>

			<h2>Legality</h2>

				I cannot be held liable for any illegal and / or copyrighted
				material that's uploaded by the users of this application.
				Files uploaded to this website are subjected to local laws. If
				laws are being broken, and I've been notified of the fact I'll

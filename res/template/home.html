			<h1>Pixeldrain Public Beta<img src="/res/img/sia.png" style="height: 40px;"/></h1>
			<p>
				Note that this is an experimental version of Pixeldrain server, 
				the Pixeldrain backend has been completely redesigned from the 
				ground up to be more extensible, efficient and scalable. The 
				server this web application runs on is considered a testing 
				environment. Database resets can happen at any moment when 
				architectural changes need to be applied.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Sia integration is still very experimental and could 
				fail at any moment resulting in data loss. Do not upload files 
				to this server that you cannot afford to lose. Use the stable 
				main server instead: 
				<a href="https://pixeldrain.com">https://pixeldrain.com</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				But don't let all that stop you from trying the new Pixeldrain! 
				The upload restrictions that the main site has haven't been 
				implemented in this version yet, so you can upload as much as 
				you want. The server only has 256 GiB of space available, if it 
				starts running out of space files will be purged from the local
				filesystem and served from Sia on the next request.
			</p>
			<h2>Legality</h2>
			<p>
				I cannot be held liable for any illegal and / or copyrighted 
				material that's uploaded by the users of this application.
				Files uploaded to this website are subjected to local laws. If 
				laws are being broken, and I've been notified of the fact I'll 
				have to delete the offending content (as the server does not 
				support geo filtering yet). If you find any files on this domain
				that break the law, please contact me at
				<a href="mailto:abuse@pixeldrain.com">abuse@pixeldrain.com</a>,
				and I'll take care of it.
				<br/>Please share responsibly. 
			</p>
			<h2>Funding</h2>
			<p>
				I'm currently paying for the Sia storage myself, since the site
				doesn't have a revenue model yet. I'd appreciate it if you could
				send some Siacoins my way:
				26117c19ca3975b315d663dcbbc19cf9c07274f441689d4392ed380b2337589ef1aacfbdc93f.
				This address goes directly to the wallet on this server which is
				used for uploading files to Sia :). I promise you it will be put
				to good use!
			</p>
